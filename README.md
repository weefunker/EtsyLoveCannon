   cd etsy-love-cannon
   ```

   - Select the `etsy-love-cannon` folder
   - The extension should now appear in your extensions list

### Method 2: Chrome Web Store (Coming Soon)

## Usage

### Basic Usage
1. **Navigate to any Etsy page** with items (shop pages, search results, category pages, etc.)
2. **Click the Etsy Love Cannon icon** in your toolbar to toggle favorite/unfavorite all items
3. **Watch the notification** to see how many items were processed

### Advanced Usage
**Right-click the extension icon** for more options:
- **"Favorite All Items"**: Only favorites currently unfavorited items
- **"Clear All Favorites"**: Only removes currently favorited items
- **"Favorite/Unfavorite All (Toggle)"**: The default toggle behavior

- **Red notifications**: Unfavoriting/clearing actions (üóëÔ∏è)
- **Gray notifications**: No action needed (ü§∑)

## How It Works

The extension uses vanilla JavaScript to:

1. **Detect favorite buttons** using multiple CSS selectors for Etsy's evolving UI
2. **Determine current state** by checking screen reader text and visual indicators
3. **Click buttons intelligently** with delays to prevent server overload
4. **Prevent duplicates** using DOM markers and execution tracking

### Supported Etsy Elements
- Modern favorite buttons (`[data-ui="favorite-listing-button"]`)
- Legacy favorite buttons (`.btn-fave`, `.favorite-button`)
- Heart icons and various button styles
- Screen reader accessibility text
